# Sonoff Homekit

![alt text](/images/homekit-badge.svg "Apple Homekit Badge")

This is a custom made firmware for the sonoff wifi smart switch that makes it compatible with the Apple Homekit!

### Homekit runs on the Sonoff ! ðŸ˜³

Unlike other projects on github, this firmware does NOT require anything else in order to work.
It is not based on the Tasmota Fw, you don't need HomeBridge running on a Raspberry-Pi or an MQTT server, a Wi-Fi connection and an Apple Device are enough!

The implementation uses Apple provided specifications for developers, so it is a stable and supported Software and it will keep working for a long time.

## Instructions

 1) Unplug your sonoff from the power line
 2) Connect your Sonoff to a serial adapter @ 3.3v
