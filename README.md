### Homekit runs on the Sonoff ! ðŸ˜³

Unlike other projects on github, this firmware does NOT require anything else in order to work.
It is not based on the Tasmota Fw, you don't need HomeBridge running on a Raspberry-Pi or an MQTT server, a Wi-Fi connection and an Apple Device are enough!

The implementation use Apple provided specifications for developers, so it is a stable and supported software and it will keep working for a long time.

Now you finally can have a HomeKit devices without spending a lot of money!
